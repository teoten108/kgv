# kgv
R package for basic statistics for environmental sciences

# Synopsis

The package kgv (Katedra geoenvironmentálních věd) was created with the purpose of automatizing routinary statistical 
analysis performed for environmental geosciences in R. Thus, most of the functions here are based on basic R commands.

As the package is for environmental sciences, some functions for chemical calculations have been added, such a molarity
(Tt.mol) and ppm (Tt.ppm). However, the original function of the package was to automatize routinary statistical analysis,
as well as plots and tables useful for publications, based on ANOVA. Therefore, the package can be useful for any researcher,
even with little knowledge of R, to make easier and practical the repetitive creations of ANOVA and some of its derivates.
Critics, commentaries, ideas and opinions about new functions related to this topic are welcome to improve the package, as
well as collaboration of code.
